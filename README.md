# Investigate-a-Dataset

# Introduction:

This dataset contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue,cast,release year.

# Tools
- Python

- Numpy

- Pandas

- Matplotlib

- Jupyter Notebook

# Conclusion:
- The data shows that when the voting average increases, the revenue will increse at well, which is associated with the customer satisfaction. the problem is that there are number of people who don't buy the movies but they watch them for free, and that will affact the revenue.

- The movies industry is grwoing over the years and it will keep gwowing in the next years

- It seems that the revenue will increase when we spent alot of on it.
